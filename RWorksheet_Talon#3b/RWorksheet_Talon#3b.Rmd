# The negative sentiments on July 14 became a majority on that day, implying that there is something negative happened.
# Peaking at July 15 followed by positive and neutral, implying that the hate continues and just increased.
# followed by July 16 and 17 having the same amount of negativity, only to drop at the lowest digits on july 20
# and rising again on July 21 claiming it as the 2nd highest. This indicates that there are negative occurances
# that was happening on those days, while others remain positive, meaning that public opinion do vary from time to time.
